# no-show-appointments

### in this repo i will upload my work of no-show-appointments.
i asked these questions:
  ##### What is The Average Age of Patients?
  ##### What are The Top 10 Neighbourhoods in terms of Appointment?
  ##### Who Visits The Doctor More Often, Males or Females?
  
after doing some data wrangling and exploration. i have arrived to these findings.
 ##### Finding 1: i found out that most applicants ranges from 18 to 55, where is the average age         is 37
 ##### Finding 2: JARDIM CAMBURI is the highest visit count Neighbourhood between other                  Neighbourhood
 ##### Finding 3-A: between age 0 and around 2 both male and female babies do visit the doctor in        a very high count
 ##### Finding 3-B: Even when the visits got plumeted in young ages, females are now much more            often to visit doctor than males
